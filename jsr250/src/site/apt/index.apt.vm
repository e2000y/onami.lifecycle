Welcome to ${project.name}!

  People often complained the Google Guice lack of support of EJB3.0 <<<@PostConstruct>>> and <<<@PreDestroy>>>
  annotations to manage the injected objects lifecycle.

  This small library aims to add that support in a lightweight yet dynamic way, allowing users define the annotations
  type they want to use to mark methods to execute once the injection is performed and when shutting down the
  application.

Before starting
